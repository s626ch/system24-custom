# system24-custom

a modification of a tui-style discord theme that was inspired by the [spicetify text theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/text)
the updates to this are somewhat independent of the upstream parent repository, as it still grabs whatever css file they push
